            <h2>Defining Categories </h2><br>
            <p> Generally speaking, prepositions can be divided into eight categories: time, place, direction or movement, agency, instrument or device, reason or purpose, connection, and origin.</p>
            <p> Many prepositions fall under a few categories so context is the key to working them out. The table below has some of the most common ones.</p>

            <p>A preposition of time describes when or for how long something occurred or will occur. The three most common prepositions of time are at, in, and on.</p> 
            <p>Each preposition of time refers to a different increment of or point in time. </p><br>

    (**Under and below can both describe something lower than something else, but under can also describe something that is directly in contact with something on top of it. For example: “The puppy hid under the blanket” is correct, whereas “The puppy hid below the blanket” is incorrect.)

<div class="agency">

    <h2 id="agency1">Prepositions of agency</h2> <br>
    <p>A preposition of agency describes a person or a thing that has caused or is causing something to occur. Sentences containing prepositions of agency are usually written in the passive voice and employ the prepositions by (for people) and with (for things). For example:</p> <br>
    <h4>“The house was built by the three siblings.” (passive)</h4>
    <h4>“The three siblings built the house.” (active)</h4>
    <h4>“Her heart is filled with emotion.” (passive)</h4> 
    <h4>“Emotion filled her heart.” (active)</h4>   
    
    <br>
</div>

<hr class="dotted-line">

<div class="instrument">
    <h2 id="instrument1">Prepositions of instrument or device</h2><br>
    <p>A preposition of instrument or device is used when describing certain technologies, machines, or devices. These prepositions are by, with, and on. Typically, by refers to methods of transportation, whereas with and on describe the use of machines and other devices. For example:</p><br>
    <h4>“Aunt Patricia returned home by ferry.” </h4>   
    <h4>“She opened the locked door with an old key.”</h4>
    <h4> “May I finish my homework on your computer?”</h4>
    
    <br>
</div>

<hr class="dotted-line">

<div class="reason">
    <h2 id="reason1">Prepositions of reason or purpose</h2><br>
    <p>A preposition of reason or purpose describes why something has occurred or will occur. Common prepositions of reason or purpose include for, through, because of, on account of, and from.</p> 
    <p> For example:</p><br>
    <h4>“Everything I did was for you.”</h4>
    <h4>“Through her bravery, we were able to escape unharmed.”</h4>
    <h4>“Because of the traffic, I was late to the airport.”</h4>
    <h4>“The employees refused to work on account of their low pay.”</h4>
    <h4>“He knows from experience how to deal with them.”</h4>
    
    <br>
</div>

<hr class="dotted-line">

<div class="connection">
    <h2 id="connection1">Prepositions of connection</h2><br>
    <p>A preposition of connection describes possession, relationships, or accompaniment. Of is used for possession, to for relationships between people or things, and with for accompaniment.</p>
    <p>For example:</p><br>
    <h4>“The Tower of London is located in London.”</h4>
    <h4>“A well-written essay is impressive to Stuart.”</h4>
    <h4>“Rosa wanted to go to the cinema with Juan.”</h4>
    
    <br>
</div>

<hr class="dotted-line">

<div class="origin">
    <h2 id="origin1">Origin</h2><br>
    <p>When we describe a person or thing’s origin (such as nationality, hometown/state, ethnicity, the place where something was built or designed, etc.), we typically use the preposition from (and, to a lesser degree, of). For example:</p><br>
    <h4>“I met the most delightful couple from Argentina.” </h4>
    <h4>“I’m from Essex originally, but I’ve lived in Buenos Aires for many years.”</h4>
    <h4>“The new professor is of Russian descent.”</h4>
    <h4>“The new computer from the tech giant should be revolutionary.”</h4>
